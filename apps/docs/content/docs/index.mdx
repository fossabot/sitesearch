title: Quickstart
description: "Our philosophy is simple: copy search experiences as components, customize freely. No complex configuration, just grab what you need and make it yours."

Sitesearch gives you a curated catalog of Algolia-powered search experiences. Copy the pieces you need, wire them to your data, and keep moving—no yak-shaving on autocomplete state machines or analytics plumbing.

Like shadcn/ui, everything lives in your repo. You can read the source, fork it, and ship variants that match your product’s tone of voice.

## Prerequisites

- [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) if you want to use the CLI.
- [Algolia account](https://dashboard.algolia.com/)
- [Algolia index](https://dashboard.algolia.com/indices)
- [Algolia API key](https://dashboard.algolia.com/api-keys)
- [Algolia Ask AI assistant](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ask-ai) (optional – only if you want to use Conversational Search)

## Why we built this

- **Move faster:** Borrow production-ready search patterns instead of prototyping from scratch.
- **Stay flexible:** Every component ships uncompiled. Change the layout, switch styling systems, or replace logic as your product evolves.
- **First-class Algolia:** We bake in search, insights, and AI answer patterns using Algolia best practices.

## How to use the docs

- Start by browsing **Experiences** to see opinionated search experiences like [Search](/docs/experiences/search) and [Search + AskAI](/docs/experiences/search-askai).
- Take experiences and components as building blocks to compose your own layouts.
